                <p class="text-faded">The iconic city of Chicago (Illinois), is widely known for its crime.
                    Surnamed Chirac because of it's crime rate comparable to the war in Irak,
                    also known for Al Capone and it's Chicago outfit during the prohibition,
                    Fred Hampton's assassination by the city's police or the sudden rise of crime in 2015 make Chicago's crime an interesting subject to study. <br> <br>
                    Through this study of 20 years of crime, we want to bring insights on the crime evolution, geographical distribution,
                    and effects on the city with an unbiased and apolitical approach to give people a fair idea of the safety of the city and its implications.</p>
