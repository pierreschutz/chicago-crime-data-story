                    The Police Department of Chicago reported more than 7 millions crime since 2001. Those crimes fall
                    into multiples categories (eg homicide, prositution...).

                    We can see what are the most frequent kind of crime.

                    In order to reduce violence, Chicago Police Department adopted new crime-fighting techniques in 2004
                    thanks to a cooperation with the LAPD (Los Angeles) and NYPD (New York City). Let's see how crime
                    has evolved since the Police started to collect crime data in 2001.
                </p>

                <p class="text-muted">


                    Indeed, crime started decreasing after 2004. However did the new techniques employed by the Police
                    lead to more arrests?

                </p>

                <img src="img/crime_evolution_with_arrest.png" width="750">

                <p class="text-muted">
                    Even though Police adopted new techniques in 2004, it seems that the proportion of arrests did not
                    increase. We can guess that the new techniques are mostly for preventing crime. They reduced the
                    number of crime rather than the number of cases closed with a criminal arrested.

                    <br>


                    Sometimes looking at the whole data at once is representative of sub-categories.That's why we will
                    have a closer look at <i>HOMICIDE</i> crimes.

                </p>

                <p class="text-muted">

                    It is very interesting because we can see a huge drop in 2004 that might be correlated with the new
                    crime-fighting techniques used by the Chicago Police. However the trend is now different than when
                    we consider all kinds of crime together. Indeed we can clearly see the rise of homicides in 2016.
                    This sudden rise of homicides was widely cover in the newspapers in the U.S.A. This huge homicide
                    rise was apparently responsible for half of the homicides that led to a rise of homicide in the USA
                    for 2016.

                    Let's try to have a spatial analysis of Chicago. It is interesting to relate areas to other factors
                    such as number of crimes, type of crimes to better understand where violence is happening.
                    We will split the city into community areas. There are 77 community areas in Chicago. A first
                    approach would be to consider the North vs the South of Chicago.

                <p class="text-muted">

                    From this map we cannot tell which part of Chicago is more violent. Let's display the total number
                    of crime per community area on the map to gain better insights.

                </p>

                <p class="text-muted">
                    We can deliver interesting insights from this map:
                </p>

                <ul class="text-muted">
                    <li>
                        Indeed as we can see the most violent zone in term of number of crime has <i>NARCOTICS</i> as its
                        first crime type. Areas where there is drug dealing are usually linked with violence. Overall the
                        zone with <i>NARCOTICS</i> as one of the top 3 crime are zones with a bigger number of crimes than
                        other.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        What is also funny is Chicago Downtown. We can find <i>DECEPTIVE PRACTICE</i> as one of the top crime.
                        It is in the downtown that you will find most of the business activities of Chicago. Thus there
                        might be a relation between high number of businesses and the number of deceptive practices that if
                        don't remember are usually linked to fraud.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the 'airport area' we can see <i>OTHER OFFENSE</i>. It might have a link with the presence of the
                        airport. Airports usually come with special legislation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One interesting fact is that areas at the edge of Chicago usually have <i>THEFT</i> as a first type of
                        crime. We can thus speculate that those areas are usually residential ones.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p class="text-muted">
                    Let's have a look at what kind of crime those <i>OTHER OFFENSE</i> in the airport area correspond.

                <p class="text-muted">

                    It seems like the most important one is <i>OTHER WEAPONS VIOLATION</i>. It seems like it is strictly
                    forbidden to have a gun in an airport in Illinois which might lead to a lot of these cases. Indeed,
                    there is generally no restrictions for other areas. <a href="https://www.chicagocriminaldefenselawyer.net/violent-crimes/weapons-charges">[3]</a>

                    <br>

                    We should compare the crime map with the homicide one.

                </figure>



                <p class="text-muted">

                    This map confirms the previous one. As we can see the areas with high density of homicides are
                    usually in community areas with narcotics as one of the top crime. It suggests that violence in
                    Chicago is related to drug dealing and more generally to criminal gang activity. <br>
                    Moreover, areas without a lot of homicide cases can are usually in the border of the city. Those
                    neighborhoods are probably residential. <br>
                    We can also think that some central areas without high number of crimes are well protected. Indeed,
                    there is not a lot of homicide cases near the downtown or the university. Those important areas are
                    usually well protected. As an example it is interesting to know that the University of Chicago has
                    its own Police Department.

                <p class="text-muted">
                    We will now see if there is a relationship between violence and demographic evolution. <br>

                <p class="text-muted">
                    The default layer is for year 2002. What can be seen is that the downtown was the most violent zone
                    area in 2002 in term of crime rate. We have to remember that people usually do not live in downtown
                    as this area is dedicated for businesses. However we can see that the crime rate for the downtown
                    decreased a lot between 2002 and 2010. It might correspond to a huge effort made by the Police to
                    fight violent in the busiest area of the town. <br>
                    We can by adding layers successively that violence is spreading in the West of Chicago with
                    community areas <i>Austin</i>, <i>Humboldt Park</i>, <i>West Garfield Park</i>, <i>East Garfield Park</i> and <i>North
                    Lawndale</i> and in the South of Chicago with community areas <i>Fuller Park</i>, <i>Englewood</i> and <i>West
                    Englewood</i> for example. <br>

                    Now let's see how population evolved between 2000 and 2010 and between 2010 and 2017. We might see
                    trends such as people living violent areas, or joining new areas.

                <br>



                <p class="text-muted">

                    It tells a lot about what is going on. <br>
                    As we can see the most violent area <i>Austin</i> had a huge population drop between 2000 and 2010. In
                    general, areas that were associated with violence in our analysis correspond to areas with a
                    population drop. <br>
                    Moreover we can clearly see that the downtown area gained population between 2000 and 2010. As we
                    realized the crime rate dropped in that area between 2002 and 2010 even though there was more and
                    more people living there. It really means that Chicago Police tried to reduce violence in the
                    downtown area. <br>
                    However from 2010 to 2017 we can see that lots of areas are concerned by population decreasing.
                    Especially the violent ones and the ones in the border of Chicago. Finally it seems that areas
                    around downtown are still atracting people.
